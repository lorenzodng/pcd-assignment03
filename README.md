# Assignment #03 -  Message Passing and Distributed Computing

v0.5.0-20250525

**1) About asyncronous message passing with actors (not distributed).**

Develop an actor-based solution of the *Concurrent Boids* problem, presented in Assignment #01, with the same GUI. Requirements (analogous to the first assignment):
- The solutions should exploit as much as possible  the key features of the actor programming model, both at the design and implementation level. 
- The solution should promote modularity, encapsulation as well as performance, reactivity. 
- The suggested framework to use is Akka, either using the Scala or Java API, following the guidelines presented in Lab. Nevertheless, a different framework and different languages than Scala or Java can be used, as far as an actor-based approach is adopted.

For every aspect not specified, students are free to choose the best approach for them.


**2) About distributed computing - To Be Announced.**


**3) [OPTIONAL] Synchronous Message Passing in Go - To Be Announced.**


### The deliverable

The deliverable must be a zipped directory `Assignment-03`, to be submitted on the course web site, including a different sub-directory for each points developed.  Each sub-directory should be structured as follows:
- `src` directory with sources
- `doc` directory with a short report in PDF (`report.pdf`). The report should include:
	- A brief analsysis of the problem, focusing in particular aspects that are relevant from concurrent point of view.
	- A description of the adopted design, the strategy and architecture.
